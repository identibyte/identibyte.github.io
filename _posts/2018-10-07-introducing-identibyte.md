# Hello, world!

[Check us out on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/identibyte)

Identibyte, at it's core, is an API that checks if an email address domain is
disposable or free. Our team has built several web apps, and we always have to
deal with the annoyance of pruning our lists and ensuring our outgoing "alert"
style emails aren't sending to disposable addresses.

**We built Identibyte to solve that problem.**

Identibyte **is not** designed specifically to block disposable email addresses.
In fact, we find them useful ourselves and believe they serve an important
purpose.  Identibyte is designed to be a simple email domain _classification_
tool that helps developers:

- Purge disposable domains from mailing lists

- Require non disposable mail addresses on _critical_ forms like billing forms
  or notification hooks.

- Sanity check and protect forms that are "giveaways" or 

- Prune metrics from accounting for dead accounts and email addresses.

Let us know what you think!
